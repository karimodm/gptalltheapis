Construct a NodeJS class with methods powered by Axios to interact with endpoints defined in a JSON OpenAPI specification that you will be provided. Each method should include authentication handling as required, console logging of interactions, and incorporate endpoint and parameter descriptions from the OpenAPI specification into the method documentation. Make sure to export the class as default as an ES6 module using the export keyword. You must return only the code block with the NodeJS class, nothing else.
