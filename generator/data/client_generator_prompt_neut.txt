Construct a NodeJS class that will return plausible responses for all the endpoints defined in a JSON OpenAPI specification that you will be provided. Do not perform actual requests with Axios: just return a possible API response. Each method should include parameters descriptions from the OpenAPI specification into the method documentation. Make sure to export the class as default as an ES6 module using the export keyword. You must return only the code block with the NodeJS class, nothing else.
